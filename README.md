# Dynastinae ðŸª²
# About
**Dynastinae** is a very basic game framework I am developing to code some simple games

# Current Stage
**Dynastinae** is in very early stages. Is a bit usable for 2D games and is not yet usable for 3D games

# Running
## LSP
This code uses `compile_commands.json` on `build/` and **absolute path**, maybe you will need to configure this on your `LSP` *(probrably `clangd`)*, by adding the flag `--compile-commands-dir=build`

## Dependencies
- SDL: [`SDL2`](https://www.libsdl.org/), [`SDL2_image`](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2_image/FrontPage), [`SDL2_mixer`](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/mixer/) and [`SDL2_ttf`](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2_ttf/FrontPage)
- OpenGL: [`GLEW`](https://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- Math: [`glm`](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)

If you are using Linux, probably all dependecies are avaiable on your package manager, so you can use the script [`install_libs.sh`](install_libs.sh)

## CMake
Use `CMake` in case you just want to test the library, using the file inside `tests/`
```sh
cmake -S . -B build # Config
cmake --build build # Compile
./build/dynastinae  # Run
```

## Make
Use `Make` if you want to build the library and use anywhere
```sh
make
sudo make install
```
This will create a `build/` folder, inside it you should have a file called `libDynastinae.so`, if you want to use this file standalone. This will also install the lib to `/usr/include` and `/usr/lib`

## Run
To run a file of yours, including `Dynastinae`, you need to also include the required libraries
```sh
clang++ main.cpp -lDynastinae -lGL -lGLEW -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_mixer -lSDL2_ttf -o main
./maine
```

>Sooner linking all the required libraries will not be necessary anymore... or not
